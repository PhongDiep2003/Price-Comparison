# Price Comparison

## Introduction

Our application streamlines the process of price comparison across multiple e-commerce platforms. Users simply enter the Amazon URL of the product they are interested in, and our app quickly scans other major e-commerce sites such as eBay to find that exact product's price. This enables users to make informed purchasing decisions, ensuring they get the best deal without the hassle of manual comparison.

## Technologies used
